This application takes as the first CLI argument the pathname of a textual file. The program prints the content of the file quadruplicating the spaces.

For instance, if the file example.txt contains:

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipisci elit,
sed eiusmod tempor incidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

The program execution will be:

./ex2-1 example.txt

Lorem    ipsum    dolor    sit    amet,
consectetur    adipisci    elit,
sed    eiusmod    tempor    incidunt    ut    labore    et    dolore    magna    aliqua.

Try to:

1) Fuzz (for a while) the application with AFL.
2) There is a nasty hidden bug that allows access to the internal memory of the application. Can you find it? Can AFL find it?
